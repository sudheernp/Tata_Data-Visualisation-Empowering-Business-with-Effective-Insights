# Online Retail Store Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights valuable to the CEO and CMO. The management is keen on understanding the key factors contributing to revenue and making strategic plans for the future. The project aims to provide operational and marketing metrics, identify successful areas, and analyze data based on demographic information.

## Phase 1: Drafting Questions
To prepare for a meeting with the CEO and CMO, you need to draft questions that address their concerns and guide your analysis. Consider both quantitative and qualitative aspects. You've been provided with a dataset for initial exploration.

### Questions for CEO:
1. Which region generates the highest and lowest revenue? How can we improve sales in lower-performing regions?
2. What is the monthly revenue trend for 2011? Can we identify any seasonal patterns? How can we use this for forecasting?
3. Which months have generated the most revenue historically, and is there a clear seasonality in sales?
4. Who are the top customers, and how much do they contribute to total revenue? How diversified is our customer base?

### Questions for CMO:
1. What percentage of customers are repeating orders? Are they purchasing the same products or different ones?
2. How long does it take for repeat customers to place their next order? How can we encourage more frequent purchases?
3. What is the revenue generated by repeat customers, and how can we retain and increase their spending?
4. Who are the top repeat customers, and how much revenue do they contribute? How can we engage and satisfy them?

## Phase 2: Creating Visuals
In this phase, you will create visualizations based on the questions from the CEO and CMO. Visuals should be clear and convey insights effectively. Clean the data by removing records with negative quantities and unit prices.

### Visuals for CEO:
1. Time Series Revenue Chart (2011): Monthly revenue trend to identify seasonality.
2. Revenue by Country Bar Chart (Excluding UK): Top 10 countries by revenue and quantity sold.
3. Top 10 Customers Contribution Chart: Visual showing revenue contributions of the top 10 customers.
4. Demand Heatmap: Visualizing demand by region, excluding the UK, to support expansion decisions.

### Visuals for CMO:
1. Customer Repeat Rate Pie Chart: Percentage of repeat customers and their product preferences.
2. Time to Next Order Histogram: Distribution of time intervals between repeat orders.
3. Repeat Customer Revenue Bar Chart: Revenue generated by repeat customers and potential growth.
4. Top 10 Repeat Customers Contribution Chart: Visualizing revenue contributions of the top 10 repeat customers.

## Phase 3: Presentation
Develop a script and record a video presentation explaining your findings and analysis to the CEO and CMO. Emphasize data cleanup, context, and actionable insights. Your video should be around 5 minutes long.

Remember, you're not just presenting visuals but providing valuable context and recommendations for business decisions.
